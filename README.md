# WebApp
This is a basic web application that i created for my sister. she is an instrcutor and she wanted to build a blog portfolio of her own. So, i decided to help her with that and i built it using HTML5, CSS, Flask, Python and hosted it on Linode.

ps:~ the default page for 404.html/404.css & 500.html/500.css have been used from open source.
